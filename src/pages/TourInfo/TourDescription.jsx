The walls of the wonder  Hole drop vertically  down  for 150 feet tot he sleeping pool in which our adrenaline junkies normally use for Scuba Diving. The pool is unbelievably blue and crystal  clear which reflects great depth non-flowing water .
The traditional name for the Caves is “Chirorodziva” which means the “Pool of the Fallen”. The name was derived from an incident which took place in the 1830s when the Angoni Tribe, who were moving northwards surprised people living near the Caves and flung them into the pool.
